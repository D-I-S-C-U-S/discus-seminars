Our first seminar presentation was on using machine learning to find rare processes.

<!--truncate-->

Meirin Evans gave a fantastic talk and has kindly shared his [presentation materials](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/no-root?filepath=13-TeV-examples/uproot_python/ttZ_ML_from_csv.ipynb) just in case you missed it, but want to know more.

Thanks Meirin for being our first speaker.
If you're reading this and would like to present - let us (@olliethomas or @imccheyne) know on Discord.

Looking forward to the next seminar on the 26th, where we havea talk from Josie Coburn on identifying and categorising complex documents.

See you then!
