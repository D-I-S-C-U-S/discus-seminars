Josie Coburn has just given a brilliant and thought-provoking talk about comparing the funding and outcomes of medical research.
This work contrasts funding and publications across diseases associated with poor nations against those of wealthier nations. 

The talk took place on the DISCUS Discord server. 
If you've not yet joined, you can do so by using the link in the footer of this page.

The slides can be found [here](/slides/JC-24-06-21.pdf).
