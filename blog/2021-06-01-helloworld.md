Hi all, Welcome to a new series of talks.

<!--truncate-->

We wanted to put together a forum where current PhD students can talk about things that interest them.
In some cases this will be about their data-based research, for others it may be about the tools that they use and workflows that have made a difference in their day-to-day lives.

We'll be listening for feedback about the exact format, frequency and length of these talks, but initally we aim to present a roughly 20-30 minute presentation every few weeks with plenty of time for Q&A.

Although the speakers will (predominantly) be current/recent PhD students here at Sussex, the audience will be made up of students at all levels - with the common thread that they all work with data.
We expect that some members of the audience may be considering remaining at Sussex themselves, so we think this is a great opportunity to demystify the day-to-day life of being a research student.

All talks will be via the DISCUS Discord Server until we can get back to campus. 
If you've not joined, you can do so [here](https://discord.gg/fYfDgHvRxb).

As you might expect, these seminars run entirely through volunteering, and we couldn't do this without the wonderful people who have already put themselves forward to present.
If there's a topic that you are passionate about and would like to present - please reach out to Oliver Thomas, or Ian McCheyne.
We're available either on Discord, or via our sussex emails (look us up in the Sussex Researcher Portal).

Thanks, and see you in the first seminar!

Oliver
